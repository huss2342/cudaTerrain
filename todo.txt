Phase 1: Implement basic 2D terrain generation with a single algorithm (start with Perlin noise maybe)
Phase 2: Add multiple terrain types and coloring
Phase 3: Implement walkability layer
Phase 4: Add more complex algorithms (cellular automata for caves, Voronoi for biomes)?
Phase 5: Add height values (z dimension) to create a 2.5D representation 
                (with paths to reach height or have some blocked off )
Phase 6: Implement a randomly placed landmark (flag..) on the map
Phase 7: Implement more advanced features (rivers, roads, etc.)


Phase 0.1: Implement a simple player movement system
Phase 0.2: Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm (A* maybe) to determine a path from the player to the landmark
