[] Phase 1: Implement basic 2D terrain generation with a single algorithm (start with Perlin noise maybe)
[] Phase 2: Add multiple terrain types and coloring
[] Phase 3: Implement walkability layer
[] Phase  3.5: Think about whether I need to generate chunks of the maps as the player moves or all at once?
    is there a performance benefit?
[] Phase 4: Add more complex algorithms (cellular automata for caves, Voronoi for biomes)?
[] Phase 5: Add height values (z dimension) to create a 2.5D representation 
                (with paths to reach height or have some blocked off )
[] Phase 6: Implement a randomly placed landmark (flags..) on the map
[] Phase 7: Implement more advanced features (rivers, roads...)

[] Phase Extra.0: Implement a randomly placed landmark (flags, fountains..) on the map
[] Phase Extra.1:: Implement more advanced features (rivers, roads...)
[] Phase Extra.2: Implement a simple player movement system
[] Phase Extra.3: Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm (A* maybe) to determine a path from the player to the landmark
